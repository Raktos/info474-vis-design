            <p>Emery Gregg, age 46</p>

            <p>Emery is a pharmaceutical researcher. His job is to create new drugs and medications to help people. The company wants
                to make a profit, but for Emery it isn't about the money it is about helping people. As such he makes proposals based
                solely on how effective he thinks a drug will be. Whether his proposals are funded past initial exploratory research or
                not us up to the company and out of his hands.</p>

            <p>Emery wants to know more about anti-bacterial drugs and their effects on various types of bacteria. He is lookaing at
                this dataset as part of his exploratory research on the subject.</p>

            <h2>Visualization 1</h2>
            <p class="question">Which drug tends to be, on average, the most effective at stopping bacterial growth and
                what is the effect of gram stainability on each drug's growth prevention?</p>

            <div class="writeup">
                <h3>Rationalization</h3>

                <p>The primary visual encoding for this visualization is position along an aligned scale. The position of any given section
                    of the box tells the reader what how high the concentration must be to efectively stop bacterial growth. The median line
                    in the middle of the boxplot is the primary data point for comparison. Because this is the most important of the comparisons
                    to be made I chose the most accurate perceptual task.</p>

                <p>The secondary encodings are comparisons of length and color. Color in this case is simple, it seperates the categoies, bacteria
                    that are gram positive, those that are gram negative, and the box that contains both. The colors are not at all similar (with the
                    possible exception of red and green for the red-green colorblind) with green indicating positive and red negative. Blue was chosen
                    for a neutral color that resembles neither green nor red.</p>

                <p>The comparisons of length allow the reader to see which drugs are the most consistant. Long boxes mean a large spread, and long
                    lines for outliers show some bacteria being more resistant. As an example, penecilin has a very large spread of concentrations to kill
                    compared to Streptomycin which has a very small range.</p>

                <p>The groupings allow the reader to see multiple points of data for each drug, and compare them within the drug and to other drugs. The
                    "Combined" bar in each drug is used to compare all values between drugs, which for example shows penicilin has much more variance. The
                    other groups in penicilin show how penicilin has very different effects on gram positive bacteria vs gram negaive bacteria. The conclusion that
                    maybe the cell wall's have something to do with how penicilin works could be made here for example.</p>

                <p>My targeted persona is a scientist and understands how concentrations work so I did not find it necessary to try and reverse
                    how concentrations are shown to put the most powerful drugs at the "top." I also adopted a logrithmic scale because of the massive range
                    that values take and rationalized it similarly, a scientist would be comfortable with a logrithmic scale.</p>

            <h2>Visualization 2</h2>
            <p class="question">Which bacteria are most resistant to drugs?</p>
            <div id="vis2-plotly" class="plot"></div>
            <div class="writeup">
                <h3>Rationalization</h3>
                <p>This visualization is very similar to the first. Position along an aligned scale is the main perceptual task which informs the reader which bacteria are most
                    resistant (highest concentrations to stop growth) and which are the least (lowest concentrations). I (attempted) to order them from most resistant
                    (highest required concentrations) to least (lowest). The boxplots are not idea for such a small data sample, but they give a good picture of
                    how resistant a bacteria is in general, and how much its resistance tends to change between different drugs.</p>

                <p>This comparison of resistance variance is done in the same way it was in visualization 1; length comparisons. With so many boxes
                    it gets a little harder to do accurate length comparisons when the lengths are very similar but across the entire dataset it is
                    easy to see which bacteria have much more variance and which have much less. This tradoff of less accuracy is acceptable as this is
                    a secondary encoding of information.</p>

                <p>As with the first visualization I used a logrithmic scale because of the huge difference between values and maintained the raw concentration
                    values instead of attempting to put most resistant bacteria at the top. The rationalization is the same, the target audience
                    is scientists who understand how the data works and would prefer the actual data instead of a transoformation of it the put
                    things a the top.</p>

            <h2>Visualization 3</h2>
            <p class="question">Which drugs are most effective against a given bacteria?</p>
            <div id="vis3-plotly" class="plot"></div>
            <div class="writeup">
                <h3>Rationalization</h3>
                <p>This visualization again uses position along an aligned as its primary visual encoding. The positions of the tops of the bars
                    indicate how much concentration is required to stop bacterial growth, higher indicating a more resistant bacteria. I used position in this,
                    as with the previous, because it is the most accurate. It show very similar information to the previous visualization but separates in that
                    it does not show the range of variance easily, but does show the individual data points for each drug.</p>

                <p>The secondary encoding is color, indicating each individual drug. The colors are relatively neutral when used with each other,
                    none indicated a relationship to another. This allows the reader to see the comparisons between each drug for each bacteria easily,
                    though it makes comparisons between different bacterias harder. That however was handled by the previous visualization.</p>

                <p>Again a logrithmic scale was used and the concentrations were left as their raw values, so a higher value means a more resistant
                    bacteria not a more effective drug. This is again rationalized by the audience; a scientist would understand if not be expecting
                    this sort of information from this sort of study.</p>
